This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Mirror to Baltic Digital Institute

Changes in this repository are automatically mirrored to `Baltic-Digital-Institute/strona-fpbg` by the workflow in `.github/workflows/mirror.yml`. It runs on every push to `main` (including tags) and uses `git push --mirror` to keep the destination repo as an exact copy.

To activate the mirror, add a personal access token with `repo` scope and push rights to `Baltic-Digital-Institute/strona-fpbg` as an [Actions secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) named `BALTIC_PUSH_TOKEN`. The workflow reads this secret when it configures the remote and pushes the mirror.
